# 1st-Milestone

🎯 Choose the Digit Game

🧩 Project Overview

This is my first milestone Python project, a simple number selection game called “Choose the Digit”.
In this game, the player is given a list of digits, and they must select a specific digit based on random or user-defined conditions.
It’s a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates the use of:
-Loops
-Lists
-Conditional statements
-Input/output handling

🚀 Features

-Randomly generates a list of digits
-Allows the user to choose a digit from the list
-Provides feedback if the chosen digit matches the target
-Simple replay option'Y' or 'N' to play again
-Beginner-friendly and fully console-based

🧠 How It Works

The program generates a list of random digits (for example: [3, 7, 1, 9, 4]).
1) It secretly picks one digit as the target.
2) The player is asked to guess which digit is chosen.
3) The program checks if the guess matches the target and displays a success or failure message.
4) The player can choose to play again or exit.

💻 Technologies Used

-Language: Python 

📸 Example Output

Welcome to the Choose the Digit Game!
Here is your list: [3, 5, 7, 2, 9]
Guess which digit was chosen: 7
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it right!
Do you want to play again? ('Y'or 'N'): Y

🧩 Learning Outcomes

From this project, I learned:
-How to work with lists and loops in Python
-How to take and validate user input
-How to use random number generation
-How to structure a simple game program

🛠️ Future Improvements

-Add a scoring system
-Include difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
-Add color to the console output for better user experience
